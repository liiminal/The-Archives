After defeating the Cragmaw Hideout's leader Klarg, you head back to the beginning of the trail, and set out with your caravan to Phandalin, this time with Sildar in tow. After a day of travel, you reach a track on some hills. The rutted track emerges from a wooded hillside, and you catch your first glimpse of Phandalin. The town consists of forty or fifty simple log buildings, some built on old fieldstone foundations. More old ruins—crumbling stone walls covered in ivy and briars—surround the newer houses and shops, showing how this must have been a much larger town in centuries past. Most of the newer buildings are set on the sides of the cart track, which widens into a muddy main street of sorts as it climbs toward a ruined manor house on a hillside at the east side of town. As you approach, you see children playing on the town green and townsfolk tending to chores or running errands at shops. Many people look up as you approach, but all return to their business as you go by. Sildar seems much more at ease. “My friends,” he says, “let us secure lodgings. I’m told the local inn is very quaint.” The said local inn is called Stonehill Inn, whilst searching Phandalin for the signs of a missing wizard

they go to inn
In the center of town stands a large, newly built roadhouse of fieldstone and rough-hewn timbers. The common room is filled with locals nursing mugs of ale or cider, all of them eyeing you with curiosity.

anubis goes to innkeep and ask about the rooms
manneo bonks his head entering the doorway

james saunters to talk into the barmaid. i tag along, because i do not want a barfight. the bard attempts to initiate a conversation, but she is gossipping with other patrons at the moment, talking about the orchard keeper in town. james orders a drink, and asks who was this orchard. "Daran Edermath? The former adventurer? He lives just past the Shrine in his orchard, can't miss it." 

The innkeep says that there are 6 rooms for rent (Sildar is taking one) and that the tap house is down the street. anubis gets a room for the rest of the gang besides kuroq and manneo, who agrees they will sleep outside in a nearby tree.

Now that the inns are settled, Anubis asks Sildar for the plan. He explains that in the morning he will start his search for clues about the wizard Iarno Albrek, and if he won't find anything, he'll go to the townmaster Harbin Wester.

but

"sooo whats someone gotta do for some discounted drinks" james winks at the bar maid (yes) 

The barmaid smirks at you. "Well, well, with that charming face of yours? Know how to show a lady a good time?"

"such a nice outfit, wonder how it would look on the floor"

*winks at you* let's find out, shall we?
The barmaid turns to the innkeep and asks to go to the cellar for a bit. [banging montage]

manneo talks to the miner. He personally is fine, but the town has been in some issues recently... “Orc raiders have been seen on the east end of Triboar Trail. The townmaster is looking for someone to run them off.” 

It's not even his problem, he tells you to bring it up with the townmaster.

The townmaster’s hall has sturdy stone walls, a pitched wooden roof, and a bell tower at the back. Posted on a board next to the front door is a notice written in Common. It reads: “REWARD—Orcs near Wyvern Tor! Those of a mind to face the orc menace should inquire within.” The notice bears the town’s seal and an indecipherable signature.

inside you see Harbin Wester, a large man who you assume to be the townmaster. Harbin is looking for someone to head east on the Triboar Trail, where travelers have reported trouble with a band of orcs near Wyvern Tor. He offers 100 gp to any group that can take care of the problem. He squints at pair tho. "You ruffians seem like you can take on them. Not now though, there's already a group out there, and I shall await their return first." He grins. "Don't wanna waste people's times"

First... as you head back into the street, you see four armed ruffians waiting for you. All of them are humans wearing grimy red cloaks, their hands on their weapons as they watch you.

One of the ruffians spits on the ground. “Time for you to move on, strangers. Give us your stuff, and be on your way.”

Anubis flourishes a flame, burning bright and dangerous. "Step back or eat dirt"

they get back to the inn,  manneo shouts for james, kuroq retorts that he wont hear him. the goliath makes fun of her. the bird attempts to punch playfully, but was still slightly ruffled from the encounter, and thus misses. they find james drunk at the tap house. they carry him to a bed and everyone passes out for the night.

As you approach the manor the Redbrand ran off to, you find a door. The door opens onto a five-foot-wide landing fifteen feet above a large cellar, with stone steps descending to the floor in two short flights. Another door stands beneath the stairs to the north. A large stone cistern occupies the western part of the room, whose walls are lined with kegs and barrels.
You appear to be in a cellar, with a large rectangular cistern/resevoir at the western end of the room (you entered through the east side). It is full of cold, fresh water. There are also barrels around the room.

Upon inspection (very very thoroughly,,, which made noise), The barrels contain salted pork and beef, flour, sugar, apples, and ale. You hear shuffling to the west as you are searching the barrels, what do you do? 

hide, kuroq wanted to steal an apple

Before you can hide (or steal anything) 3 Redbrands rush out of a door next to the Cistern and take all of you by suprise!

After a quite long (and lowkey annoying) encounter, they took a short rest, bandaging themselves up. What other dangers are they going to find here?
