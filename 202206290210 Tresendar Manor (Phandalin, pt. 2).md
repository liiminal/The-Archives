1:56 am - 4:50 am
with Normal, Knight, Mucus (halfway through)

The door opens onto a five-foot-wide landing fifteen feet above a large cellar, with stone steps descending to the floor in two short flights. Another door stands beneath the stairs to the north. A large stone cistern occupies the western part of the room, whose walls are lined with kegs and barrels. Last time, three Redbrands came from a door to the right of the cistern after the party searched the barrels in the room.

We investigate the barracks, where the Redbrands came from.

This appears to be a storeroom pressed into service as living quarters. Two double bunks stand against the wall near the door, while barrels and crates fill the southern half of the chamber.

After inspecting, we check the north.
Thick dust covers the flagstones of this somber hallway. The walls are decorated with faux columns every ten feet, and the double doors at the west end of the hall are sheathed in copper plate, now green with age. A relief carving of a mournful angel graces the doors.

Leading the way, we approached the doors, but a pit suddenly opens. I couldn't dodge in time, and fell in.

Anubis and Manneo helps me up, and attempt to jump over the pit. manneo falls. anubis makes it over barely, and helps manneo up the pit. I jump over and make it over safely. 

Opening the door, three large stone sarcophagi stand within this dusty crypt, and propped up against each sarcophagus is a human skeleton clad in bits of rusty mail. False columns along the walls are carved in the image of spreading oak trees. The double doors in the southeast corner (the doors you went through) are sheathed in tarnished copper plate. As Anubis moves over to inspect the bodies, they being to rattle and move, heading towards us. 

After dealing with them, we find that there are doors to the north and east past the tombs. We voted for the North door.

you enter through the north door and see a small corridor, with a door to the east, and a wall to the west. I checked the walls for suspicious traps of any sort.

Suddenly a section of the wall swings open to another area. This area is the north end of a large natural cavern, but it has been finished with dressed stone block walls and a flagstone floor. Several barrels are stored against the walls here, along with a number of empty crates, straw for packing, hammers, pry bars, and nails.

The cavern continues for some distance to the south. You can make out several passages that open up off the larger cavern, and what looks like a deep pit or crevasse in the floor.

We took a quick rest to gather ourselves and regroup. We decided to check the east door first, then cehck out the cavern afterwards.

Heading the east door, this long room is partitioned into three areas, with iron bars walling off the north and south. Filthy straw lines the floors of those cells, the hinged doors of which are secured by chains and padlocks. A pair of disheveled human women are held in the cell to the south, while a human boy is confined to the north. All are dressed in plain gray tunics and have iron collars fitted around their necks.

A heap of discarded clothing is piled carelessly against the far wall. However, as you enter, two ruffians attack you by suprise from both sides of the door. The battle wasn't going great at first, but we managed to deal with them. 

Hearing the fighting going on, Balagog enters sprinting, morning star in hand. Busts down the door only to see the ruffians already dead with the party members very confused as to why he was so late. The two slaves look upon Balagog in terror and slight confusion.

We quickly explained the situation and took turns breaking the chains that held them. We almost gave up (with Anubis slamming the wall in frustration), but Manneo succesfully breaks it and the prisoners are freed. I point them into the exit and bid them farewell.

Filing back out and into the cavern, A cold breeze fills this large natural cavern, carrying with it the faint scent of decaying flesh. A crevasse divides the cavern and is flanked by two rough stone columns that support the twenty-foot-high ceiling. Two arched wooden bridges span the chasm. The bridges were shit, but we began to cross anyways. Me, with the luxury of wings, begins to fly through, but something stops me.

As the rest cross the bridge, your mind is filled with foul murmurs and demands for food as a nothic reveals itself, it is not immediately hostile, and is willing to communicate 

After a bit of chaos and arguing—whether Anubis should offer the jerky or just get salted pork back from the barrels, or whether we push off the Nothic, as Manneo suggests; almost releasing its wrath—we ended up offering the pork. The creature acc, he points you into a dark hole in the crevasse, presumably the "treasure" you asked for, you can make out the dark figure of a chest or container.

We split the loot that we got. I got a spell of Augury. Well, I can't exactly use it... for now.

you can go down the stairs the nothic was guarding (two sets, one to the north, one to the south). Investigating both reveals that the northern stairs lead to a small corridor, with more doors, north and south, the second set leads into an L shaped hall, with a northern door leading to the first stairs' southern room, and a southern door. we went for the northern room first.

This room appears to be a wizard’s workshop. A rat scurries across the floor and takes refuge under a large worktable set up with alembics, retorts, distillation coils, and other alchemical devices, all of it stewing and bubbling away. Bookshelves are crowded with sheaves of parchment and strange-looking tomes.

"Is anyone here?!" Balagog shouts out.

"Please donut yell." I say, both as a joke and a precautionary because we *really* need to stop making too much noise.

"DONUUUUT!!" I sigh.

The small rat scurries up to them, curious. "Aw, hello there." Balagog says, reaching out to it with his finger. Anubis casts Beast Bond. Albeit it works, the rat just looks up at him, unwavering and unaffected at all. As if its already loyal to someone else, or magical in some way. Figuring we can't do anything else to the rat, we leave it be.

Moving on to the worktable, Anubis recognizes an apparatus made to brew invisibility potions, although it has yet to succeed. He fiddles with it, and succesfully gets one potion of invisibility. 

We check a door on the east. It reveals to be a bedchamber, the walls  with drapes of scarlet cloth. The furnishings include a small writing desk with matching chair, a comfortable-looking bed, and a wooden chest at the foot of the bed. A secret door is slightly ajar to the east, with a letter on the table bearing a black spider sigil.

The chest is empty. The wizard has fled. The letter reads:

*Lord Albrek,

*My spies in Neverwinter tell me that strangers are due to arrive in Phandalin. They could be working for the dwarves. Capture them if you can, kill them if you must, but don’t allow them to upset our plans. See that any dwarven maps in their possession are delivered to me with haste. I’m counting on you, Iarno. Don’t disappoint me.*

Back out in the cavern, we go into the south room.

Several worn tables and chairs are scattered around this large room. Wooden benches are drawn up against walls decorated with draperies of brown and red, and several ale kegs are propped up and tapped.

Four tough-looking human warriors wearing scarlet cloaks are gathered around one of the tables. A stack of coins and trinkets is heaped upon the tabletop between them. They are quite obviously drunk, slurred conversations passing through their lips.

Balagog, the trigger-happy fighter that he is, immediately takes advantage and bashes through their heads.

After the drunkards have been sorted out, I took their loot—lots of coins, and a gold earring set. Hey, shiny!
