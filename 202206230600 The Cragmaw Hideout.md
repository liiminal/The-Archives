```
In the city of Neverwinter, a dwarf named Gundren Rockseeker asked you to bring a wagonload of provisions to the rough-and-tumble settlement of Phandalin, a couple of days’ travel southeast of the city. Gundren was clearly excited and more than a little secretive about his reasons for the trip, saying only that he and his brothers had found “something big,” and that he’d pay you ten gold pieces each for escorting his supplies safely to Barthen’s Provisions, a trading post in Phandalin. He then set out ahead of you on horse, along with a warrior escort named Sildar Hallwinter, claiming he needed to arrive early to “take care of business.”

You’ve spent the last few days following the High Road south from Neverwinter, and you’ve just recently veered east along the Triboar Trail. You’ve encountered no trouble so far, but this territory can be dangerous. Bandits and outlaws have been known to lurk along the trail.
```

Rhelmis: He is my brother's son's second cousin's friend. I only know him from sight; does not really speak to him. It is quite odd for him to seek my help.

Balagog: I know gundren from my village, I remember helping him with some errands once, so I suppose that's why he called me

Again, I know him because we live in the same place, and I've gotten a reputation of helping people around there, even helped gundren with some stuff once, so he offered me this job. 

Anubis had been following Gundren Rockseeker for quite a while. As a druid, protection of nature was like [**is**] a duty to me. When I heard of the news that Gundren was up to something involving the mines, I was instantly on high alert. I disguised myself as a merchant, and met him in a local bar. Few drinks, some sweet talk and he told me he was planning something big. I offered him supplies to help him and he lapped it up. So now here I was, following him to whatever he planned to do and hoping to stop it.

amogus: maid?? 
- gundren pays her nice, and and this will surely bring a smile to his face
- I was doing my duties all around the village, when this small guy came into my vacinity. And told me that if "I help, he happy". and i did?

Manneo is a retired soldier looking for any kind of work to get me by, Gundren happened to see me wondering and offered me this job. Should be easy enough

Kuroq:
James:

```
With Gundren needing a party to bring the provisions to Phandalin, you all need to decide the marching order in the Wagon. Who will be up front, Who will be at the rear? One or two players need to be driving the wagon, the others may do as they like. Anyone can drive a wagon, with two oxens moving only when the reins are held. The wagon is packed full of an assortment of mining supplies and food. This includes a dozen sacks of flour, several casks of salted pork, two kegs of strong ale, shovels, picks, and crowbars (about a dozen each), and five lanterns with a small barrel of oil (about fifty flasks in volume). The total value of the cargo is 100 gp.
```

amogus is riding the oxens

manneo & balagog at front, followed by amogus (rider) and rhelmis [i dont know where rhelmis is]. anubis brings up the rear.

```
You’ve been on the Triboar Trail for about half a day. As you come around a bend, you spot two dead horses sprawled about fifty feet ahead of you, blocking the path. Each has several black-feathered arrows sticking out of it. The woods press close to the trail here, with a steep embankment and dense thickets on either side. What would you like to do? Investigate, move on, etc. All are valid answers
```

They all choose to investigate

[DM does a perception check]

```
As your investigating the bodies 4 goblins jump out and ambush you!
```

[Roll Initiative]
Turn order: G1, Balagog, Rhelmis, Anubis, Manneo, G2, Amogus, G3-4

Goblin 1 attacks Rhelmis, misses
Balagog attacks G1, does 10 dmg, kills G1
Rhelmis attacks G3, misses
Anubis attacks ???, misses
Manneo attacks G2, does 11 dmg, kills G2
Amogus attacks G3, does 5 dmg
G3 attacks amogus, misses [like an idiot]
G4 attacks Balagog, misses [lol]
Balagog attacks G3 [i think?], misses
Rhelmis attacks G3, he ded

```

Before they can absolutely demolish G4, he escapes into an unfamiliar trail

They investigate, the area: it has been used to stage more ambushes. Anubis realizes about a dozen or so goblins have come down this trail, and you also recognize signs of two human sized bodies being hauled away from the ambush site.
```

 They follow the trail, tying the oxen behind.
 Manneo leads with Anubis, with amogus and Rhelmis in the middle and Balagog at the end.
 
```
About 10 minutes down the trail, Manneo spots a (poorly laid) snare trap. you all sort of shimmy around it.

Another ten minutes go by, and as you are walking, anubis notices an odd looking piece of terrain... would you like to ignore it?
```

Everyone panics to not ignore it. Turns out it's a dirt trail.
LOL SIKE Anubis trips into a pitfall. They fall and take 5 damage. They are... at 2 hp. wait smth happens here im confused but i think DM rerolls so now anubis has 6/7 hp instead

They arrive at The Cragmaw Hideout, gaining [75 xp]

Following the goblins’ trail, they  come across a large cave in a hillside five miles from the scene of the ambush. A shallow stream flows out of the cave mouth, which is screened by dense briar thickets. A narrow dry path leads into the cave on the right-hand side of the stream.

Anubis checks around for clues, but all there is to see is the narrow path on the other side of the stream and the end of the path they were on.

Everyone wants to drink water (well, rhelmis and amogus. balagog kinda just wanna kill things. and manneo). "can the emss kit hold water?" amogus asks. "Bozo," Balagog scoffs, "You got a water skin."

"Isn't that for like when you wanna wear a raincoat?"

"I'd rather be the one to lead, being a druid nature is my thing." Anubis says. They look back at the party. "Y'all, we march. Now." Balagog grunts in agreement.

"BUT WATER," Rhelmis practically whines. 

They end up crossing anyways. 

[hc that they ended up staying here because they're pissbabies]

On the east side of the stream flowing from the cave mouth, a small area in the briar thickets has been hollowed out to form a lookout post or blind. Wooden planks flatten out the briars and provide room for guards to lie hidden and watch the area—including a pair of goblins lurking there right now! As you splash across the stream goblins start shooting at you through the thickets. They rush to the cave for cover. Just inside the cave mouth, a few uneven stone steps lead up to a small, dank chamber on the east side of the passage. The cave narrows to a steep fissure at the far end, and is filled with the stench of animals. Savage snarls and the sounds of rattling chains greet your ears where three wolves are chained up just inside the opening. Each wolf’s chain leads to an iron rod driven into the base of a stalagmite.

[Anubis tries to befriend but fails]

And as they pass through, the cave gets darker and darker.... From now on you will need Darkvision or a light source to see. Balagog has darkvision (because he's epic). He ends up lighting a torch anyways, with Anubis taking some fire in their hands for the extra light. 

The main passage from the cave mouth climbs steeply upward, the stream plunging and splashing down its west side. In the shadows, a side passage leads west across the other side of the stream. In the shadows of the ceiling to the north, you can just make out the dim shape of a rickety bridge of wood and rope crossing over the passage ahead of you. Another passage intersects this one, twenty feet above the floor. 
In the dim light, there is a figure of a goblin on the bridge. Balagog tries to shoot it with a crossbow, but misses. He flees into an unseen passage, gone for now.

The stream passage continues up beyond another set of uneven steps ahead, bending eastward as it goes. A waterfall sounds out from a larger cavern somewhere ahead of you. As you continue up the eastward spiral steps you make it to the bridge the goblin was on. Balagog glints that past the bridge, there is a passageway that turns to the left. They go through here. 

[amogus and rhelmis had to go at this point]

And as you turn down the passage, it opens up into a cave area. This large cave is divided in half by a ten-foot-high escarpment. A steep natural staircase leads from the lower portion to the upper ledge. The air is hazy with the smoke of a cooking fire, and pungent from the smell of poorly cured hides and unwashed goblins. 4 goblins are cooking at a fire in the lower part. A goblin leader is at the top, and Sildar is chained next to him, beaten and bruised. The leader very clearly sees them, but does not do anything.

turn order was: Manneo, Goblin 1, Goblin 2, Balgog, Goblin 3, Anubis, Goblin 4

(they were lacking 2 players and were having shit rolls so everything was. going terribly sideways)

Yeemik, the leader of those goblins you just killed grabs sildar and yells "Truce, or he dies!" He explains he wants to overthrow the real boss of this hideout. He promises he will give you Sildar in return. Sildar, pained, warns not to trust him. What do you do?

they went fuck it and refused the offer

ok, he shoves sildar off the ledge (he is now unconcious) and jumps down to fight you.

THEY DID AN EPIC FIGHT AND ALMOST DIED but manneo finished it by cleaving a a greatsword into his head. 

So with Yeemik dead, would you like to pursue the leader he was trying to overthrow? After all, he *is* the boss of this hideout of goblins.

kuroq: I've been separate from the party but i have known Gundren for a while, and was trying to locate him but encountered you guys instead 
james: you're a bard, you follow Liminal to write a song about their adventure

As you all are resting...  two unfamiliar figures walk up to you. They explain they followed tracked next to your caravan and heard fighting from the cave, so they ran in. They introduce themselves as James and Kuroq respectively. (im bad at writing lmao)

Ok so after a bit of exploring, you find a open cave. Sacks and crates of looted provisions are piled up in the south end of this large cave. To the west, the floor slopes toward a narrow opening that descends into darkness. A larger opening leads north down a set of natural stone steps, the roar of falling water echoing from beyond. In the middle of the cavern, the coals of a large fire smolder. Standing around these coals is Klarg and his mangy wolf Ripper. What do you do?

yeemik was the second-in command at Cragmaw Hideout, and he wanted to oust Klarg to become the leader of that hideout.

(klarg is apprently the boss yeemik was tryna overthrow and idk where *that* information came from)

manneo, balagog and kuroq shoots at klang whilse anubis tries to tame the wolf. cham was out at the first half so james stared at rock
