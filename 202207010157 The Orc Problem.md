After the whole manor has been sorted out, the party decides where to go next. Manneo goes back to the inn. Anubis and Balagog

Wyvern Tor is a sizable hill, with miles of rugged terrain on its flanks and slopes. You'll need to search for the hidden camp, but it takes time. Once per in-game hour, you make a wisdom or survival check to find the camp, made by the character leading the way

Hours pass by. 3 hours later (1pm), Anubis spots something. The faint smell of smoke hangs on the air as you ascend a rugged ridge on the lower slopes of the hill. Fifty yards away, a cave mouth opens up at the bottom of a ravine. Hunkered down by a boulder twenty yards outside the cave, keeping watch, is a single orc.

Balagog aims, and shoots it down.

Looking on, we find one large orc that appears to be the leader, six ordinary orcs, and a filthy ogre inside the cave. We aim for the leader, and the rest of the orcs flee. I doubt they will return. We made short work of the ogre after that. We split the loot and headed back to the inn.
